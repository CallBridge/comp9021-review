1.Why create this project?

Actually Eric Martin has give an excellent lecture however it's a bit of too tough to catch up the pace.

Thanks for our cool professor!

This project is to review some of the codes on lectures and labs.

2.What's the difference between my project and Martin's tar package on edstem.org?

I got more personal understanding and my own code.

I will give my understanding as notation in every code file.

3. This is something funditional, what if it is too easy for me?

Try my another project, called algorithm collection.
